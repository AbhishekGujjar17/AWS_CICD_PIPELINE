	<h1>DevOps CI/CD Deployment Pipeline with AWS and Terraform</h1>
	<img src="./img1.png" alt="Image related to DevOps and CI/CD">

	<p>This project implements a full deployment devops pipeline on AWS using various services such as CodeCommit,
		CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, ECS (Elastic Container Service), ECR, Target Groups, Application Load
		Balancer (ALB), and ECS Fargate. The pipeline automates the process of deploying code changes to an ECS Fargate
		cluster with a CI/CD pipeline.</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>The deployment pipeline is comprised of the following stages:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>CodeCommit</strong>: Developers push code changes to a CodeCommit repository.</li>
		<li><strong>CodeBuild</strong>: CodeBuild automatically pulls the latest changes from the CodeCommit repository,
			builds a container image, and stores it in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).</li>
		<li><strong>CodePipeline</strong>: CodePipeline orchestrates the workflow, triggering builds on commit and
			deploying the application.</li>
		<li><strong>ECS Cluster Creation</strong>: CodePipeline, through the CodeDeploy stage, deploys the changes to the
			container running within specified ECS Cluster.</li>
		<li><strong>Target Groups and ALB</strong>: Target Groups and an Application Load Balancer are provisioned to
			manage traffic to the ECS Fargate tasks.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>AWS Account</strong>: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage
			resources. Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials locally.</li>
		<li><strong>Terraform Installed</strong>: Ensure Terraform is installed on your machine, and you can successfully
			run Terraform commands.</li>
		<li><strong>CodeCommit Credentials</strong>: You'll need IAM user credentials with permissions to push code to
			CodeCommit repositories.
			<ul>
				<li>If you don't have an IAM user, create one.</li>
				<li>Access the IAM service console, navigate to "Users," select the desired user, and choose "Security
					credentials." </li>
				<li>Scroll down and click "Generate credentials" under the Git credentials section. </li>
				<li>These credentials will be required when you clone the repository from CodeCommit.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Deployment Steps</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>: Clone this repository to your local machine.
			<code>git clone https://github.com/AbhishekGujjar17/AWS_CICD_PIPELINE.git</code>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Terraform Commands</strong>: Navigate to the `terraform` directory and open the `main.tf` file.
			Replace the `vpc_id` variable with the ID of your VPC, and then run the following Terraform commands one by one:
			<pre><code>terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Push Changes to Code Repository</strong>: After successfully deploying the module, you may encounter
			errors in CodePipeline and ECS service when registering targets. Don't worry about these errors; they occur
			because your code hasn't been deployed yet.
			<ul>
				<li>Go to the CodeCommit repository that you just deployed using the module.</li>
				<li>Clone that repository, make your changes, and push them.</li>
				<li>This will trigger a successful run of the CodePipeline. CodePipeline runs automatically whenever changes
					are pushed to the CodeCommit repository, eliminating the need for manual intervention.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Accessing the Website</strong>: Once you've completed step 3 and utilized the code files available in
			this repository, such as the `index.html`, `Dockerfile`, and `buildspec.yml`, you can access the website by
			using the DNS of the ALB (Application Load Balancer). The website will appear as follows:</li>
		<li><strong>Destroying Resources</strong>: If you've created this project solely for learning purposes and wish to
			avoid any further costs on your AWS account, please execute the following Terraform command to destroy all the
			resources created using the module:
			<pre><code>terraform destroy</code></pre>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This project is highly customizable to suit your specific project requirements. For instance, you can easily
			replace steps within the CodePipeline or integrate GitHub instead of CodeCommit, among other possibilities.</li>
		<li>Currently, the project utilizes public subnets and may grant broader permissions to resources than strictly
			necessary. Depending on your project's needs or if deploying internally within an organization, consider
			deploying only to private subnets and tightening permissions accordingly.</li>
		<li>While this project isn't covered by the AWS free tier and may incur some costs, they typically range between
			$1 to $2 if you create, test, and then promptly destroy the resources. However, leaving them running
			continuously will result in a gradual increase in your bill.</li>
